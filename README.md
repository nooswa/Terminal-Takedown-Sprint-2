# Terminal Takedown

## About

Terminal Takedown is a 2D rogue-like game (endless wave survival) designed for computer science students preparing for technical job interviews. Set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by androids, players must hack the androids using their programming or cybersecurity knowledge to survive.

## Motivation

The constant pressure of preparing for technical interviews as computer science students — paired with the frustration of unrealistic hacking portrayals in games — inspired the creation of Terminal Takedown.

Our mantra: *“Preparing for technical interviews shouldn't be a daunting task.”*

No more late nights suffering through endless LeetCode grinds. Terminal Takedown aims to transform interview prep into an enjoyable, accessible, and engaging experience.
